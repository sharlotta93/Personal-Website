      <h2>How I started</h2>
      <p>I started training at the end June 2017. I had not done martial arts prior to
      that and when I arrived at the Cross Combat gym 15 minutes before my first class I signed up
      for a full membership. I picked the gym because of the location and I didn’t research it
      apart from looking at the website - I am glad. My gym is notorious for receiving one star reviews
      and if that had altered my decision I would not be where I am today.</p>

      <h2>My favourite art</h2>
      <p>I was very enthusiastic about training and I went to every single class
      that I could which was at least 5 times a week. At first I did muay thai, kickboxing and wrestling.
      Wrestling was my favourite by far. I think I really enjoyed being able to wrestle with guys twice my size
      and when I ‘won’ by getting a take down I felt invincible.  I was somewhat reluctant to start Brazillian Jiu Jitsu.
      At first it looked very intimidating and skillful, I didn’t know what was happening or even who was winning
      when I saw people rolling on the ground.</p>

      <h2>What I fell in love with</h2>
      <p>I don’t quite remember my first classes. I remember that people were shouting that I should stop falling off and
      be a better partner. The classes were frustrating because I felt I was not getting it
      and I didn’t understand what I should do next. Then after a few weeks I was sparring with someone
      and I swept them over. What I felt at that moment was incredible: accomplishment and exhilaration,
      something I had not experienced in a long time. I knew at that moment I will never stop practicing
      and learning bjj.</p>

            It is such a broad question! First of all I would say good job for making that first step, it is by far the most difficult one.
            Then I would say don’t be afraid to roll with guys, 90% of gyms will be male dominated and it is rather unlikely you will be able to roll with just girls. I didn’t have a problem with that but I can see some girls can be quite squeamish about it. I am not saying go against a guy twice your size but it is worth recognizing that throughout your bjj career you will end up training with mainly males and that doesn’t have to be a bad thing!
            Second, invest in some protective clothing. I am not saying go all out and by all your rash guards at once but a long sleeve running top and long bottoms will protect you from mat burns. Once you know this is something you wish to pursue you can invest in proper rash guards and splash some cash. Here is a golden tip: make sure your sport bras don’t have any metal parts and invest in male boxers. It was a game changing experience when I used them for the first time!

            It will depend on you. It took me a month to get my first submission and that was the first time I felt really good about it but not at it. Even now that I am a blue belt I have lots of things I want to work on and there is still so much to learn. I know I will never be truly satisfied with my technique until I reach a black belt and that can take around 10 years!

            That’s probably the hardest question. For the longest of times I was told that if I decided to go for an armbar I will do everything in my power to get that submission. I thought it was a compliment but as it turns out what it meant is I would sacrifice 5 better moves in order to get that armbar. These days I am a lot more flexible and adaptable and that was a big step forward.  I know this doesn’t quite answer the question. Right now I am constantly told to stretch after each training and I don’t. I know it’s bad and I will do my best to follow that advice.

            I lift weights 3 times a week. This is a great way to get toned and since I started that training I experience a lot less injuries than before. Lifting weights is great to improve your bone density and I am a lot less tired during the classes.
            Moreover, in an ideal world I would also do yoga once or twice a week to ensure flexibility. It's also a great way to relax and be in tune with your body. For now it's more sporadic than I wish for it to be but it's a work in progress for me.
