      <h3>Why I got into programming<h3>
      <p>When working in hospitality industry you do the best you can with the tools you have and more often than not the digital tools are outdated. This became very clear when I started working for an online fashion retailer- the systems used were time consuming to navigate and not easy to use.</p>

          <div class="text"><p>Growing up in a country in which I could not understand the language was a very challenging experience - it took me 2 years to be able to communicate and express myself effectively. The hospitality industry taught me how to communicate non-verbally and with people who don’t speak English. Exposure to these people made me want to learn other languages.  Currently  I am fluent in Polish, speak basic Dutch and I am learning Spanish. Within the next 6 years I am planning to be fluent in Spanish, French and Italian.</p></div>
